# String functions

Provides string transformation utility functions.

## Basic Usage

Place the transform where you would like the output to be placed and provide the input string as the value for the
InputString Parameter. The example below shows converting an input parameter to upper case and setting it as the value
for a tag on an s3 bucket.

```yaml
Parameters:
  InputString:
    Default: "This is a test input string"
    Type: String
Resources:
  S3Bucket:
    Type: "AWS::S3::Bucket"
    Properties:
      Tags:
        - Key: Upper
          Value:
            'Fn::Transform':
             - Name: 'String'
               Parameters:
                 InputString: !Ref InputString
                 Operation: Upper
```

## Available Operations

### Upper

Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters converted to uppercase.

### Lower

Return a copy of the string with all the cased characters [4] converted to lowercase.

### Capitalize

Return a copy of the string with its first character capitalized and the rest lowercased.

### Title

are lowercase.

### SwapCase

### Strip

prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped.

### Replace

Return a copy of the string with all occurrences of substring `Old` replaced by `New`.

#### Additional Parameters

*Old*: [required] sub-string to search for

characters from the end of the string.
